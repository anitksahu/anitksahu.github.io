== Welcome
Hi! and welcome to my website. My name is Anit Kumar Sahu. I am a Senior Applied Scientist in the Distributed ML Science team in Amazon Alexa AI. Previously, I was a Machine Learning Research Scientist at the [https://www.bosch-ai.com/our-people/team-pittsburgh/ Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence], Pittsburgh. I obtained my PhD from the [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/ Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering] at [http://www.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon University] in  November 2018, where I was advised by [https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~soummyak/ Prof. Soummya Kar] [https://figshare.com/articles/Inference_and_Optimization_over_Networks_Communication_Efficiency_and_Optimality/7447967/1 \[Thesis\]]. 

Before joining CMU, I spent 5 beautiful years and simultaneously earned my B.Tech and M.Tech degrees in the [http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ernet.in/ Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering] 
at [http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Technology,Kharagpur]. 
I worked with [http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ernet.in/faculty/MChakraborty/ Prof. Mrityunjoy Chakraborty] during my undergraduate days in IIT Kharagpur.

I am broadly interested in the fields of Optimization, Distributed Inference and Statistical Machine Learning. I am interested in applying techniques related to optimization towards Robust Deep Learning and Learning/Optimizing on Edge Devices, i.e., Federated Learning.
